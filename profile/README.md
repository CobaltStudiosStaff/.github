We have been absolutely blown away by the community support for Cobalt teams and the sheer amount of you that have reached out to us over the past few weeks.

## 🚀 Purpose

> *"Teamwork makes the dream work."*

Cobalt Studios offers a unique place for developers to:

- 🤝 Share ideas
- 📖 Learn from each other
- 🎮 Geek out over development projects

We provide **high-quality services, support, and plugins** for our community. While Cobalt may seem like a business, we firmly believe that developers deserve fair earnings. **100% of service work and personal projects go to the developer who does the work.**

## 👨‍💻 Meet the Team

Cobalt Studios currently consists of a team of **14 skilled developers**. Most of us hang out in **VC**, so feel free to drop by and say hi!
